### Writing Option 1: The formation of ABPSi (5 points)

This assignment involves reading a paper about the formation of the Association of Black Psychologists, and then completing a writing activity. The citation for the paper is:

Williams, R. (1974). A History of the Association of Black Psychologists: Early Formation and Development. Journal of Black Psychology, 1(1), 9–24. https://doi.org/10/gg3hq4

You can obtain the paper through the library, or download it from this assignment on Canvas.

This is a fairly open-ended writing assignment. Your task is to read the paper, and then describe what you learned from the paper in at least 200 words using full sentences (feel free to write more if you want). Submit your writing to this assignment posted on Canvas.

This assignment will be graded pass/fail, with a possibility of partial points. I am looking for evidence that you engaged in the reading and writing process.


### Writing Option 2: APA's apology (5 points)

In October 2021, the American Psychological Association issued an apology to People of Color for APA’s Role in Promoting, Perpetuating, and Failing to Challenge Racism, Racial Discrimination, and Human Hierarchy in U.S.

<https://www.apa.org/about/policy/racism-apology>

The above website contains the apology, and additional information providing context for the apology. 

This is a fairly open-ended writing assignment. Your task is to visit and read through the above website. Then describe what you learned from this process in at least 200 words using full sentences (feel free to write more if you want). Submit your writing to this assignment posted on Canvas.

This assignment will be graded pass/fail, with a possibility of partial points. I am looking for evidence that you engaged in the reading and writing process. I am not expecting you to read and memorize the entire website. Use your own discretion on how much time you put into reviewing the material, and direct your own reading towards points of interest that you may want to write about.
