The following assignments are not associated with a specific learning module. Instead, these more general assignments that engage you in various aspects of cognitive psychology. See the general assignment section on Canvas for information about submitting and due dates.

## Write a QALMRI for new research (5 points)

Your assignment is to find a new research article published in a cognitive journal (must be published since 2020), download the article, read it, and then write a short QALMRI assignment. Review the [QALMRI method here](https://teaching-cognition.github.io/cognition/textbook/C1_What_is_Cognition.html#the-qalmri-method).

This mini-lecture gives a primer on reading primary research, and the QALMRI method.

1. **Find an article**: You can search [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) for new papers, or you can read the table of contents of journals online. Check out this [list of cognitive journals from the course website](https://www.crumplab.com/cognition/articles/course_docs/resources.html). Choose any article that is about cognition and looks interesting to you.
2. **Obtain the article**: You should be able to download most journal articles through the Brooklyn College library. You may also be able to find copies online.
3. **Read the article**: Scan the article to see what it is about. Your goal will be to write a QALMRI to help you make sense of the article
4. **Write a QALMRI**: Using [the QALMRI method](https://crumplab.com/cognition/textbook/C1_What_is_Cognition.html#the-qalmri-method), write a one-page QALMRI (point form is OK) of the paper you chose.

- Question: Identify the big and specific question
- Alternatives: What are the alternative hypotheses or explanations
- Logic: What are the logical implications of the hypotheses
- Method: Describe the Methods
- Results: What was the main result
- Inference: What inferences about the hypothesis are made from the results?

It is OK if you find the research article confusing. The purpose of this exercise is to try as best as you can, and get a general sense of what it is like to search for and read articles in cognition.


## Write a Short Answer question (5 points)

Write your own short answer question (appropriate for a midterm or final exam) that would test a concept from any aspect of Cognitive Psychology covered in this course. Then, provide an answer to the question in at least 100 words that could be used as an example of a high-quality answer that should receive full marks.

Submit the wording for your question and your answer.

Example:

To give an example, the following could appear as a short answer question on an exam testing content in the Memory I chapter.

**Question**: How does the multi-store model (Atkinson and Shiffrin) explain the recency effect, and why is it unable to explain the long-term recency effect?

**Answer**: The multi-store model uses a short-term rehearsal buffer to explain the recency effect. The recency effect is the finding that words at the end of a list are typically recalled better than words in the middle of the list. According to the model, the words at the end of list are being actively rehearsed in the short-term rehearsal buffer. As result, all of the words in the buffer are available when participants recall the words. Specifically, during the recall phase, participants may simply write down the words they are rehearsing. As a result, recall memory is higher for the words at the end of the list (which are in the buffer and recalled immediately), compared to words in the middle of the list, which are likely not in the rehearsal buffer. The long-term recency effect occurs when a long delay intervenes between the encoding phase and recall phase. Over this period of time it is likely that any short-term rehearsal buffer no longer contains any words from the encoding phase (i.e., participants stop actively rehearsing words). Nevertheless, the long-term recency effect shows better recall memory for words at the end of a list compared to words from the middle of the list. This finding is not well explained by the concept of a short-term rehearsal process, because people are assumed to have ceased rehearsing well-before the final recall test.

## React to a highly cited paper (5 points)

In at least 250 words, your task is to read and write a reaction to a highly cited paper in Cognitive Psychology. 

1. Choose your paper from the appendix found at the end of the paper below. This appendix lists many highly cited papers in Cognitive Psychology. 

Cho, K. W., Tse, C. S., & Neely, J. H. (2012). Citation rates for experimental psychology articles published between 1950 and 2004: Top-cited articles in behavioral cognitive psychology. Memory & cognition, 40(7), 1132-1161.

2.Obtain the .pdf and read it

3. Write your reaction to the paper in at least 250 words, and submit it here.

4. Also submit the pdf, link, or citation to your chosen paper.

**Tips**: Part of this assignment involves obtaining your chosen paper. I recommend that you copy the citation for the paper into Google Scholar to find out if there is a pdf available. If not, then attempt to download the paper through the Brooklyn College library. You could put the title of the paper into ONE search and see if it finds an online version, or search for the journal containing the article, and find it through an e-journal portal.
