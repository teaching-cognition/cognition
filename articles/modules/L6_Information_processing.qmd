### Writing Option 1: Reflect on Turing's paper 

In class, we briefly discussed Alan Turing's idea of "imitation game" and how it continues to influence the study of cognition. In this writing assignment, you get to read Turing's original paper (available on Canvas):

- Turing, A. M. (1950). Computing Machine and Intelligence. *MIND*, *LIX*, 433-460. 

The paper is long, but feel free to read as much as you find interesting (I recommend reading at least up to page 10). In your response (at least 250 words), you should specify the pages you read and whether or not you think the test proposed by Turing is an appropriate measure of intelligence and/or cognition.

### Writing Option 2: Answer two short answer questions

Answer the following questions:

- Describe Dondersâ€™ subtractive logic using an example and then discuss at least two potential issues with this logic.

- Describe: 

  - What the set-size effect refers to in a choice-reaction time experiment.
  - Describe what the Hick-Hyman law refers to.
  - Eplain the repetition priming confound, and describe how repetition priming could explain performance in choice-reaction time tasks showing evidence of the Hick-Hyman law.
